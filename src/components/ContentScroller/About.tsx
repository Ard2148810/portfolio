                    I'm Computer Science student (7th semester) at Technological University of Lodz. My programming
                    story begins in 2013 when I have learnt my first programming language â€“ C++. It was the time when
                    I realised how huge is the potential in programming. Lately I've been focusing on modern front-end
                    technologies like React, TypeScript or SASS.

                    My fields of interest are very wide, they cover psychology, economy, technology and many
                    more. My favourite sport is table tennis but I also like running.
